The 35 trusts are independent bodies that are contracted to provide probation services to NOMS. They have their own grading structure which is not directly translatable to the Civil Service grades. All payroll probation staff have therefore been entered under the 'other' category.

A new system for collecting workforce information from the probation trusts was implemented in July 2012. The previous collection system (HR Data Warehouse) was decommissioned at the end of June 2012 and replaced by a series of HR returns to the NOMS Performance Hub. The new collection system enables improved reporting, due to clarification on the funding arrangements of staff seconded out of trusts. NOMS has therefore been able to provide accurate figures on the number of staff that are funded by the probation trusts from July 2012 onwards. These figures will therefore not correlate with figures provided prior to July 2012, as those figures would have included all funded and unfunded staff.

The 35 trusts are independent bodies that are contracted to provide probation services to NOMS. They have their own grading structure which is not directly translatable to the Civil Service grades. All payroll probation staff have therefore been entered under the 'other' category.
A new system for collecting workforce information from the probation trusts was implemented in July 2012. The previous collection system (HR Data Warehouse) was decommissioned at the end of June 2012 and replaced by a series of HR returns to the NOMS Performance Hub. The new collection system enables improved reporting, due to clarification on the funding arrangements of staff seconded out of trusts. NOMS has therefore been able to provide accurate figures on the number of staff that are funded by the probation trusts from July 2012 onwards. These figures will therefore not correlate with figures provided prior to July 2012, as those figures would have included all funded and unfunded staff.  It should be noted that there was a
significant reduction in staff at London Probation Trust this 
month as a result of staff transferring out due to the 
community payback competition (this relates to a fall in 
payroll staff of 225.18 fte/292 headcount and a fall in 
non-payroll staff of 107 fte & headcount)",,1367,,

The 35 trusts are independent bodies that are contracted to provide probation services to NOMS. They have their own grading structure which is not directly translatable to the Civil Service grades. All payroll probation staff have therefore been entered under the 'other' category.

A new system for collecting workforce information from the probation trusts was implemented in July 2012. The previous collection system (HR Data Warehouse) was decommissioned at the end of June 2012 and replaced by a series of HR returns to the NOMS Performance Hub. The new collection system enables improved reporting, due to clarification on the funding arrangements of staff seconded out of trusts. NOMS has therefore been able to provide accurate figures on the number of staff that are funded by the probation trusts from July 2012 onwards. These figures will therefore not correlate with figures provided prior to July 2012, as those figures would have included all funded and unfunded staff.
  
Please note, not all of the trusts were able to submit data for this month due to staffing issues and therefore the 
most recent data they had submitted has been used. 
The trusts that fall in this category are Avon & Somerset 
and South Yorkshire 
(June 2013 figures included for both)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ",,1357,,

The 35 trusts are independent bodies that are contracted to provide probation services to NOMS. They have their own grading structure which is not directly translatable to the Civil Service grades. All payroll probation staff have therefore been entered under the 'other' category.

The Probation Service staffing figures provided relate to a snapshot of the number of staff employed and funded by the probation trusts at the end of the last day of the reporting period.

The UK Border Agency costs have decreased compared to March 2012 as Border Force costs are now met from the core Home Office rather than the UK Border Agency, following a Machinery of Government change.  £2.2M has been added to the PDR bonus line to reflect the accrual that should have gone in  it is probable that some of this will relate to Border Force but UKBA have not been able to aggregate it as yet.  A further £1.5m has been added to overtime in UKBA  again for a missing accrual.

The 35 trusts are independent bodies that are contracted to provide probation services to NOMS. They have their own grading structure which is not directly translatable to the Civil Service grades. All payroll probation staff have therefore been entered under the 'other' category.

The Probation Service staffing figures provided relate to a snapshot of the number of staff employed and funded by the probation trusts at the end of the last day of the reporting period.

STAFFING NUMBERS VALIDATED
The 35 trusts are independent bodies that are contracted to provide probation services to NOMS. They have their own grading structure which is not directly translatable to the Civil Service grades. All payroll probation staff have therefore been entered under the 'other' category.

The Probation Service staffing figures provided relate to a snapshot of the number of staff employed and funded by the probation trusts at the end of the last day of the reporting period.
